Hello, in this repository you will find my homework for the Module 14 Challenge. This homework has been made with the help of differents sources: Tutor, Xpert Learning Assistant, and my teammate Yesmelin P.

Assignment: 

Build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

1) Create a horizontal barchart
2) Create a bubble chart
3) Display the sample's metadata
4) Update all the plots when a new sample is selected
